---

I am a technical writer. Have been one for close to two decades. I break down complex technical information, mentor writers, design processes, and implement tools to make documentation better and products better with documentation. My primary focus is on the developer experience of the customers that use our products. Both in and out of traditional documentation.

Outside of my official work, I have developed open-source tools to make documentation better. I have also made small contributions to an open-source project or two. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/nrynss).

I live with my wife and two kids in our own little world. My anchor and my rock.

I spend an inordinate amount of time on a computer. The tiny one, small one, the big one, and virtual ones. Anything with a screen. Sometimes without.

## Timeline of my career

{{< timeline >}}

{{< timeline-item company="Endor Labs" period="June 2024 - Present" align="left" >}}
An AI-ready application security company with the best-in-class SCA and DevSecOps tools. I write about application security, DevSecOps, and more. I own and develop processes and tools to make docs-as-code flow better and create tools to leverage documentation to build a better product experience. I partner with the product and engineering teams to build a better developer experience for our customers. I have built tools to fix Markdown tables, developed API command builders for customers, and dynamic custom bundling of docs based on use cases. I have won two hackathons in a row, one as part of a team with a new area for the product and another for a POC to embed contextual help within the product user interface.

At Endor Labs, I have the good fortune of working with an amazing team and excellent people. The freedom to experiment with tools and processes is immense.

{{< timeline-item company="JFrog" period="May 2021 - June 2024" align="right" >}}
A DevSecOps company, primarily known for Artifactory. I was part of the Platform Infrastructure team. I wrote about JFrog platform components, installation, and Kubernetes implementation. I was the content architect in charge of the documentation tools. JFrog documentation is in Paligo, but displayed in Fluid Topics. I was in charge of the migration from Confluence to Paligo. JFrog had a large set of documentation with a lot of problematic content that needed to be fixed before migration. I developed the processes to work in Paligo within a structure after the laisez faire authoring approach in Confluence. I developed an extensive system for reusable components that stopped customers from accidentally upgrading to a new version without the proper requirements in place. I drove stylesheet changes to alleviate customer pains in using the docs site.

JFrog documentation was primarily written in Confluence and I played a critical role in migrating it to Paligo.

After my stint at Siemens, I was itching to get more technical. I was fortunate to join JFrog where I was able to explore DevOps, Kubernetes, and security. I worked with amazing people and it was a great experience.

{{< timeline-item company="Siemens" period="Nov 2015 - May 2021" align="left" >}}
A global technology conglomerate. For the majority of my tenure, I was part of the eMeter product group. I was brought in to build and lead the India docs team from scratch, after a failed attempt to create a docs team in the India HQ at Noida. Eventhough I worked from the Bangalore office, for all intents and purposes, I was a remote worker with my R&D teams in Noida and Foster City. I built a team in Bangalore and also in Noida. We managed to build the confidence to drive the end-to-end release process from Bangalore. I developed the documentation for the complex technical installation and upgrade processes for the eMeter products. I was able to leave a self-sustained team at the end of my tenure. Post eMeter, I worked with the eCar and eBus products in the Siemens Energy group. 

eMeter documentation was in Confluence. I honestly do not recall the name of the tool that Energy group used. It was a rather horrid that required logging in ancient Windows machines through Citrix.

Siemens was a good company to work for. eMeter team was a delight. The larger documentation team had a variety of writers across various domains.

{{< timeline-item company="Informatica" period="Sep 2008 - Nov 2015" align="right" >}}
A global leader in data integration software. I was part of the Informatica Documentation team. I wrote about Informatica products, including PowerCenter, PowerExchange Adapters, Informatica installers, and platform administration. I was part of the documentation tools group. I was responsible for teaching, troubleshooting, and resolving issues with the documentation tools for the India and Israel teams.

Informatica gave me a tremendous opportunity to grow as a technical writer. I was super lucky to work with several seasoned technical writers to whom I owe a lot and saw the India team grow from 3 to 20+ writers.

{{< timeline-item company="SunTec" period="Sep 2006 - Sep2008" align="left" >}}
A leader in transaction business management software. I was hired just out of college and worked on the Rating and Pricing modules. Great insight into the banking and telecom business domains.

Gods we were young as a fat king would say! All of us where very young and it was often the case of blind leading the blind. But we did a lot of stuff in this timespan and pretty much crafted the entire documentation set.
