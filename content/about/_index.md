I am a technical writer. Have been one for close to two decades.

I live with my wife and two kids in our own little world.

I spend an inordinate amount of time on a computer. The tiny one, small one, the big one, and virtual ones. Anything with a screen. Sometimes without.

## Timeline of my career

Endor Labs is an application security company. I write about application security, DevSecOps, and a lot of other stuff. Endor Labs documentation is in Hugo and I spend a considerable amount of time extending it for various use cases. I also set the process and style guide for the team.

At Endor Labs, I have the good fortune of working with an amazing team and excellent people. The freedom to experiment with tools and processes is immense.


JFrog is a DevSecOps company, primarily known for Artifactory. I was part of the Platform Infrastructure team. I wrote about JFrog platform components, installation, and Kubernetes implementation. I was the content architect in charge of the documentation tools. JFrog documentation is in Paligo, but displayed in Fluid Topics. JFrog documentation was primarily written in Confluence and I played a critical role in migrating it to Paligo.

After my stint at Siemens, I was itching to get more technical. I was fortunate to join JFrog where I was able to explore DevOps, Kubernetes, and a lot of other stuff. I worked with amazing people and it was a great experience.


Siemens is a global technology conglomerate. For the majority of my tenure,I was part of the eMeter product group. I wrote primarily about the technical components of the eMeter products. Towards the end of my tenure, I worked with the documentation of the eCar and eBus products in the Siemens Energy group. eMeter documentation was in Confluence. I honestly do not recall the name of the tool that Energy group used. It was rather horrid that required logging in ancient Windows machines through Citrix.

Siemens was a good company to work for. eMeter team was a delight, and I was able to build the India docs team pretty much from scratch. The larger documentation team had a variety of writers across various domains.


Informatica is a global leader in data integration software. I was part of the Informatica Documentation team. I wrote about Informatica products, including PowerCenter, PowerExchange Adapters, Informatica installers, and platform administration.

Informatica gave me a tremendous opportunity to grow as a technical writer. I was super lucky to work with several seasoned technical writers to whom I owe a lot and saw the India team grow from 3 to 20+ writers.


SunTec is a leader in transaction business management software. I was hired just out of college and worked on the Rating and Pricing modules. Great insight into the banking and telecom business domains.

Gods we were young as a fat king would say! All of us where very young and it was often the case of blind leading the blind. But we did a lot of stuff in this timespan and pretty much crafted the entire documentation set.
