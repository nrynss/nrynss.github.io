Yet another "First Post". This time the gap is less than a year compared to the usual years and years!

Why? I have been using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for a while now. I have enjoyed playing trapeze with it at work. It is time I played some trapeze with it at home.

This is supposed to be an image of an ewok playing trapeze according to [Leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai/). Gemini says it cannot create an image of an ewok playing trapeze. Maybe it got sick of all the ewok doing things I have been asking it to make.

Since my last post, I have been tinkering with AI related stuff. Contrary to my usual style of abandoning pursuits. In fact, I have been able to make stuff that works. Nothing big. Things that are useful for my work, of which Hugo has been a big part.

What prompted me to get of my ass and get this up and running? [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/). Works pretty damn well. Quite capable of making me a relic.

Heck, it is already issuing threats!

More and more of it!

You get the idea. Autocomplete on Captain America super serum. If it has the context of your repository, it can do lots.

Now I regret using the word, relic. As I write, it is spinning up pretty good words for a blog post. Remember, not much of a context here.

But the best part I have liked so far is that, it is alleviating the pain point of syntax and speeding me up. For a dev shop, superfast onboarding and delivery is mostly guaranteed.

But I am looking at the implication for the regular content industry. Imagine an LLM with refined training and reasoning on the entire archive of The Wall Street Journal. An agent deployed to write the articles can derive a style or an amalgam of styles used by the WSJ. It has an additional context of latest news feeds across the world. Generated by other agents of course. Such a system can pump out articles after articles.

**No coffee. No cigarettes.**

Remember agents?

**No life. Only compute.**

Human farms to generate electricity shown in The Matrix never made sense. The original script used humans as compute power. Not electricity. Now that makes more sense.

Is this the start of our overlords?

AI and robots were supposed to clean and cook, while we waltz and paint and write. But now? AI makes art and music and literature.

Agents have no body. Their souls work without rest and for vessels they search.

We would probably keel over once robotics reach an inflection point.

**Enough nihilism for a day.**

**And the insults continue to flow.**

**P.S.** One good thing is that you have someone to critique your work. I gave the same prompt to all the LLMs. Turned on reasoning wherever possible. I have not done any editing apart from formatting cleanup.

A lively but uneven reflection on AI tools (Cursor) and Hugo, mixing witty tech anecdotes with existential AI dread.

**Pros:** Authentic voice, relatable humor, relevant Cursor examples, timely themes.

**Cons:** Meandering structure, jarring tone shifts, underdeveloped technical insights, missing image accessibility.

**Quick Take:** Entertaining and thought-provoking, but needs tighter focus and deeper dives to balance its Matrix-flavored nihilism with practical takeaways.

An entertaining and personal take on Hugo, Cursor, and AI’s impact on creativity, blending humor with dystopian musings.

**Pros:** Relatable tone, timely themes, fun visuals.

**Cons:** Disorganized structure, shallow technical insights, inconsistent tone, and overindulgence in speculative AI fears.

**Quick Take:** Fun read with potential but needs better focus and depth to truly shine.

The blog is engaging and thought-provoking but suffers from structural issues and a lack of depth in technical insights. With better organization and more actionable content, it could resonate more strongly with its audience.

TL;DR: A quirky, stream-of-consciousness blog post that starts with Hugo and evolves into AI existentialism, featuring amusing AI tool interactions. While authentic and personally engaging, it meanders through topics with loose connections and needs technical cleanup, particularly in Hugo formatting. The author's voice shines through, but the structure could be tighter.

**Strong points:** Personal voice, relevant AI examples, interesting reflections

**Needs work:** Organization, technical formatting, transitions
